                We may not be able to accept requests for which the quality of the work cannot be guaranteed due to lack of painting style or drawing ability, or for periods when it is difficult to secure a schedule. <br>
                We may not respond to requests for services, invitations to exhibitions, communications from overseas, etc. <br>
                Please note.
